# Python-Deep-Dive-2

Welcome to the Python 3: Deep Dive Course Repository! This repository contains a collection of projects and materials from the "Deep Dive" series, specifically focusing on Part 2. In this course, we explore various advanced Python topics, including sequences, iterables, iterators, generators, comprehensions, context managers, and generator-based coroutines.

## Course Overview

- **Sequences**: Learn about Python's sequence protocol, slicing, and how to create your own sequence data types.

- **Iterables and Iterators**: Explore the iterable and iterator protocols, understand the difference between them, and implement your own iterable objects.

- **Generators**: Dive into the world of generators, generator functions, and comprehension counterparts (generator expressions).

- **Comprehensions**: Gain insights into comprehensions, their scoping rules, and potential pitfalls.

- **Context Managers**: Discover the power of context managers in Python and learn how to create and utilize your own.

- **Iteration Tools**: Explore the itertools module and its often-overlooked functions, making your code more efficient.

- **Coroutines**: Learn how to use generators to create coroutine-based solutions.
